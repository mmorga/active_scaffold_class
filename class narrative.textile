h1. Intro

To talk about scaffolding we'll be building a piece of an example application.

So as an example we're going to build an online cd store.

h1. Building the Basic Application

h2. Requirements and Dependencies

* Ruby version 1.8.6 or 1.8.7
* Rails version 2.3.4
* Download the rails template from my github.  http://github.com/mmorga/active_scaffold_class
* I'll be using the following gems:
** mbleigh-acts-as-taggable-on
** thoughtbot-shoulda
** thoughtbot-factory_girl
** mislav-will_paginate
** mmorga-money
** ruby-graphviz (if we have time)
* Install graphviz also (which is required by the ruby-graphviz library)
Starting off you'll want to run the template and create your baseline app framework.

rails -m template.rb cdspin

This will ask for your sudo password so it can install the required gems.

h2. Build The First Model

h3. First Time Try it Old School 

*(to remember why we don't do this anymore)*

script/generate scaffold album title:string release_date:datetime
rake db:migrate
script/server

Browse to: http://localhost:3000/albums

Pretty ugly, right?

h2. Let's Make it a Little Better

rm app/views/layouts/albums.html.erb

Try - again.  Ooh that's a little nicer.  But the actual form sucks pretty bad.  So let's start up the active scaffold mojo.

Add this to your application.html.erb layout:

<%= javascript_include_tag :defaults %>
<%= active_scaffold_includes %>

And in your album controller, remove all of the lines in the class and replace with the following:

  active_scaffold :album

Also you need to remove all of the view files that were created.

rm app/views/albums/*
